        <b>TextUtils</b> is a ReactJs website built primarily to do various
        operations on regular typed text. You can safely use WordPad or NotePad
        for text drafting, and saving, but <i>TextUtils</i> offers much more
        than simple text drafting and formatting. TextUtils can convert your
        text to any case in just one simple click of a button. It can extract
        links and numbers safely from a labyrinth of random text or
        sophisticated documentation. It has an improved property of base64
        encoding, reversal of your inputted text.You can even remove whitespaces
        from your scripted documents, and wear up your earphones to listen to
        it, instead of straining your eyes! It does a detailed analyzing of your
        text, and provides an output of words, and characters, along with
        reading time as well. The best part of <i>TextUtils</i> is that it is an
        open source project, as a result, dozens of new features are in the
        upcoming, which definitely makes it a cut above the rest. <br />
        The most eminent features of the website are as follows :
      </p>
        <div>
            <h2>

          </h2>
        </div>
          
             <p>It is a <i>Simple Text Analyzer</i> , which mutilates your text,
              but in a tender way
              </p>
